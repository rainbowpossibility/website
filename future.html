        <h1>Future Asks &amp; In-Kind Dreams</h1>
        <p>In addition to monetary donations, we’re always looking for tangible materials and equipment that can live in the classroom and be used directly by students. These are the big-ticket or high-impact items we’re dreaming about—if any of these are in your world, we’d love to talk.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>High-Impact Materials &amp; Tools</h2>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="pill">
            <strong>Everyday build materials.</strong>
            Acrylic sheets (clear and colored), plywood, sheet metal, fasteners, and other stock materials students can cut, drill, and assemble into working mechanisms.
          </div>
          <div class="pill">
            <strong>Shop tools &amp; machines.</strong>
            Classroom-friendly tools like a benchtop band saw, drill press, scroll saw, CNC router, or fiber laser cutter that let students fabricate real parts safely on campus.
          </div>
          <div class="pill">
            <strong>Big dream items.</strong>
            Touch-sensitive LED panels, robust electronics for large interactive builds, or a metal 3D printer setup that would open entirely new kinds of student projects.
          </div>

        <h2>Want to Help?</h2>
        <p>If you or your organization might have surplus materials, gently used equipment, or access to any of these kinds of tools, please reach out at <a href="mailto:info@rainbowpossibility.org">info@rainbowpossibility.org</a>.</p>
        <p>We’re happy to talk through classroom fit, safety requirements, and how students would actually use what you’re able to share.</p>
