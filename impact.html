        <h1>Our Impact</h1>
        <p>This page will grow into a running record of what we’ve actually funded—grouped by school year—and the projects those materials unlocked for students.</p>

        <h2>Past Projects (Snapshot)</h2>
        <p>Here are some examples of the kinds of work your support has already made possible:</p>
        <ul class="board">
          <li><strong>Motors and magnets:</strong> Life-size student-built “Go-Fish” game modeled after the toddler magnetic toy, scaled up with working motors and custom catches.</li>
          <li><strong>Paint and color:</strong> Classroom-safe paints so students can personalize and decorate their finished creations.</li>
          <li><strong>Elastic tubing:</strong> Components for a student-made giant slingshot project exploring tension, energy storage, and launch mechanics.</li>
          <li><strong>3-phase motor controller:</strong> For student-engineered axial-flux motor builds testing torque, coil balance, and power delivery.</li>
          <li><strong>Prusa MK4S 3D printer:</strong> High-reliability printer supporting rapid prototyping and iterative design in engineering classes.</li>
          <li><strong>PLA filament:</strong> Ongoing stock for student prototypes and replacement parts across multiple engineering projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Wood and screws:</strong> Used for a three-person table maze that teaches cooperation, precision, and spatial reasoning.</li>
          <li><strong>Toothpicks, hot glue, and eggs:</strong> Supplies for the annual Physics Egg Drop challenge—students design and test impact-resistant structures using simple materials and real eggs.</li>
          <li><strong>Fabric and flexible materials:</strong> Used in a student-designed “fidget glove” exploring tactile design and wearable engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Helps Students</h2>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="pill"><strong>Labs run on time.</strong> Materials on hand prevent cancellations and lost instructional minutes.</div>
          <div class="pill"><strong>Iterate &amp; improve.</strong> Extra parts let students test, fail safely, fix, and try again.</div>
          <div class="pill"><strong>Career skills.</strong> Real tools and workflows build confidence for internships and college labs.</div>
